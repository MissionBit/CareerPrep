<h1>While Loops</h1>
<section>
<h2>Fun With Loops!</h2>
<p>The <b>while loop</b> looks a lot like an <b>if statement</b>. They both execute their associated <b>code block</b> based on the result of their <b>conditional expression</b>. The difference being, the while loop will repeatedly check its conditional expression and continue to run its code block as long as it evaluates to true. <b>Give it a try:</b></p>
<alert>Don't you dare copy & paste!</alert>
<pre><code class="javascript">var n = 0

console.log("I am called the Count... because I really love to count!")

while (n < 10) {
  console.log(n, "ha-ha-ha")
  n++
}

console.log('fin!')</code></pre>

<p><b>Exercise:</b> Write a while loop that counts from 0 to 50 by twos</p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="javascript">var n = 100, song = ''

while ( n >= 0 ) {
  if ( n !== 0 ) {
    song = song + ' ' + n + " bottles of beer on the wall! chug, chug, chug"
  } else {
    song+= " no bottles of beer! stumble, stumble, stumble..."
  }
  n--
}

document.querySelector('#lyrics').textContent = song</code></pre>
<p>Create a super-quick HTML document that displays the above. Pretty messy right? Now try the following:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">var n = 100, song = '&lt;ul class=lyrics&gt;'

while ( n >= 0 ) {
  if ( n !== 0 ) {
    song = song + '&lt;li&gt;' + n + " bottle" + (n === 1 ? '' : 's')
    + " of beer on the wall! chug, chug, chug&lt;/li&gt;"
  } else {
    song+= "&lt;li&gt;no bottles of beer! stumble, stumble, stumble...&lt;/li&gt;"
  }
  n--
}
song += "&lt;/ul&gt;"

document.querySelector('#lyrics').innerHTML = song</code></pre>
<p><b>Exercise:</b> Fencepost Loop</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a variable <code>n</code> and assign it an integer.</li>
  <li>Code a while loop that builds as a single string, the numbers 1 through n, separated by commas</li>
  <li>How can we make sure not to have a comma after the last number? e.g., for <code>n = 9</code> print <code>"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9"</code></li>
  <li>Use <code>.textContent</code> to place that string into a div#target in the HTML document.</li>
  <li>Now change your code to create a string full of &lt;p&gt; tags, with the number inside, and with &lt;hr&gt; dividers between them (but not after the last one), and use <code>.innerHTML</code> to place them into the page.</li>
  <li>Give odd numbers a class of "odd", even numbers a class of "even." Have a css rule inside your &lt;style&gt; tag that styles them differently.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<pre><code class="javascript">var n = 1, sum = 0

while ( n <= 10 ) {
  sum = sum + n
  n++
}

// Why n - 1 ?
console.log("The sum of the numbers 1 through " + (n - 1) + " is " + sum)</code></pre>
<p><b>Exercise:</b> Cumulative Sum</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write a while loop that computes the product of multiplying the first n positive integers: product = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n.</li>
  <li>Use <code>.innerHTML</code> to place a formatted piece of text into the HTML document that explains what <code>n</code> was and what the product of the numbers computed to.</li>
  <li>Give the tags different classes and ids that match pre-written CSS with some styling to make it a bit prettier.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<pre><code class="javascript">var n = 0

while ( n <= 20 ) {
  if ( n !== 13 && n % 2 === 0 ) {
    console.log("I like the number " + n + ", a nice even number.")
  } else if ( n !== 13 && n % 2 !== 0 ) {
    console.log("I like the number " + n + ", odd is okay too!")
  } else {
    console.log("la-la-la, nothing to say here")
  }
  n++
}</code></pre>
<p><b>Exercise:</b> Refactor the code above. What improvements can be made?</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Exercise:</b> FizzBuzz</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write a program that console.log's the numbers from 1 to 100</li>
  <li>Now for numbers that are multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of that number</li>
  <li>For the multiples of five print "Buzz" instead of that number</li>
  <li>For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"</li>
  <li>Instead of console.logging construct a long string and use textContent to place it in a div</li>
  <li>Now put each number in a div tag. Give 'fizz', 'buzz', and 'fizzbuzz' different classes and style appropriately. Use innerHTML to place it all on the page after the looping is done.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Nested While Loops</h3>
<pre><code class="javascript">var i = 0, j, n = 5

while ( i < n ) {
  j = 0 // What happens if we remove this line?
  while ( j < n ) {
    console.log("i is", i, "and j is", j)
    j++
  }
  i++
}</code></pre>
  <p><b>Exercise:</b> <code>n</code> numbers are coming to a number party. Introduce them each to all the guests as they arrive. You should end up with output looking something like this one for <code>n = 5</code>:</p>
  <pre>
  "welcome 1"
  "welcome 2, meet 1"
  "welcome 3, meet 1 and 2"
  "welcome 4, meet 1, 2 and 3"
  "welcome 5, meet 1, 2, 3 and 4"
  </pre>

<p>The <b>Math</b> object holds <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip" data-tip="pieces of information associated with an object">properties</a> and <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip" data-tip="properties of type function, which are meant to be run with the invocation operator ()">methods</a> related to Mathematics. Figure out what each of the following does:</p>
<code><ul class="code">
  <li>&gt; Math</li>
  <li>&gt; Math.PI</li>
  <li>&gt; Math.E</li>
  <li>&gt; Math.pow(9, 2)</li>
  <li>&gt; Math.random()</li>
  <li>&gt; Math.floor(7.2)</li>
  <li>&gt; Math.ceil(7.2)</li>
  <li>&gt; Math.ceil( Math.random() * 10 )</li>
  <li>&gt; Math.ceil( Math.random() * 10 )</li>
</ul></code>
<p>How about?</p>
<code><ul class="code">
  <li>&gt; parseInt("23")</li>
  <li>&gt; parseInt(23)</li>
  <li>&gt; parseInt("boink")</li>
</ul></code>
<pre><code class="javascript">var input

while( !(input = prompt('write something...')) ){
  console.log("you didn't write anything")
}

console.log("yay, you did it! you wrote: " + input)</code></pre>

  <p><b>Exercise:</b> Write code to ask a user to enter an integer greater than 0. Keep asking for a number until it is valid.</p>
  <p><b>Exercise:</b> Write code to play rock, paper, scissors with the user.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Ask for input until the user enters either "R", "P", or "S"</li>
    <li>Use <code>Math.random()</code> to choose a play for the computer</li>
    <li>Tell the user what the outcome was</li>
    <li>Ask the user if they'd like to play again</li>
  </ol>
  <p><b>Exercise:</b> Guess a Number</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Prompt the user for an input to determine what the highest integer <code>n</code> should be. use <code>parseInt(n)</code> to convert it from a string to a number. As long as the result is NaN, ask them again.</li>
    <li>Generate a random number between 1 and n.</li>
    <li>Ask the user to guess the number. Tell them if their guess is too high or too low.</li>
    <li>Loop until they guess correctly</li>
    <li>Use <code>.innerHTML</code> to show them something fun as a reward for guessing correctly.</li>
    <li>Show them what number was the correct number in the end.</li>
    <li>Use a counter to let them know how many guesses it took them to get the right number.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><b>Exercise:</b> Interest Rate Calculator</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ask the user for three pieces of information: a starting balance, a target balance, and an interest rate (entered as 0.05 for 5%, for example)</li>
  <li>Use a <code>while</code> loop to calculate the number of investment periods required for the starting balance to have grown larger than the target balance</li>
  <li>Set the textContent of a div#output to explain the answer to the user: "To grow an initial investment of $1000 to $2000 at 4.5% will require..."</li>
</ol>
