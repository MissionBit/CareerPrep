<h2>A little about computers...</h2>
<p>A computer is essentially an adding machine wired to a clock that ticks/ performs a simple calculation a couple billion times a second, querying and saving back data to a storage device (hard drive or memory) as it goes. <a href="http://www.simplecpu.com/" target="_blank">Learn more... <span class='icon'>&#x238B;</span></a></p>

<h3>Operating System</h3>

<p>The operating system is the program (series of instructions) that runs when you turn on your computer. It handles inputs (keyboard, mouse, camera, network connections) and outputs (monitor, speakers, network connections), manages shared access to computing resources and memory, and reads and writes data to the file system on behalf of any number of simultaneously running applications (web browser, code editor, text document, music player, etc) </p>

<h3>User Interfaces</h3>

<p>Computers can receive user input through either a command line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).</p>

<p>In a command line interface (A.K.A. "Console", "Terminal", or "Shell"), the user types commands using the keyboard to tell the computer to take an action. The computer will display the results of the operation by writing text to the screen.</p>

<p>In a graphical user interface, the mouse is used to interact with <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-tip="emulating the aesthetics of physical objects- in this case, the files, folders, calendars and desktops of an office environment" class="tooltip">skeuomorphic</a> icons to open files and applications, navigate the file system, or change settings as well as input text through the keyboard which is passed to the currently "focused" element (such as the body of an email or the URL bar in your browser).</p>

<p>Graphical user interfaces are generally thought easier to use. Command lines allow programmers more powerful and fine-grained control over their computers.</p>

<h3>File System</h3>

<p>The file system organizes the data stored on your hard disk. The underlying storage mechanism has no concept of a file, it only knows of disk blocks, containing binary data, numbered sequentially by their memory address.</p>

<p>The file system does the translation between the formless series of 1's and 0's and the <strong>data structures</strong> the users interact with (files organized in folders).</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>Make a folder on the desktop to hold all your code for this course.</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>[CMD + TAB]</code> to switch to <code>Finder</code></li>
  <li><code>[CMD + SHIFT + D]</code> to open your file system to the Desktop folder</li>
  <li><code>[CMD + SHIFT + N]</code> to create a new folder</li>
  <li><a href="https://atom.io/">Download Atom</a> and move it to your Applications folder.</li>
  <li>Open the search bar <code>[CMD + SPACE]</code> and type <code>atom</code> to open it</li>
  <li>Create a new window <code>[CMD + SHIFT + N]</code></li>
  <li>Create a new file <code>[CMD + N]</code></li>
  <li>Write a short poem</li>
  <li>Save <code>[CMD + S]</code> the file into your code folder with a <code>.txt</code> <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-tip="The dot-deliniated suffix of a file name indicating its encoding (file format), thus by what rules it should be evaluated." class="tooltip">file extension</a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A note on file names:</strong> For practical reasons to do with how files are referenced in different contexts, always save files in all lower case letters with no spaces. We recommend <code>using_underscores.html</code></p>

<p>Interview your partner and create a text document introducing them (they should make one introducing you, too). Here are some ideas to get you started:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A short bio</li>
  <li>What is their programming background?</li>
  <li>Why do they want to learn to code?</li>
  <li>What are their goals for this course specifically?</li>
  <li>Other hobbies and interests?</li>
  <li>What are their favorite websites?</li>
</ol>

<p>Be prepared to give a 30 second presentation introducing your partner.</p>
