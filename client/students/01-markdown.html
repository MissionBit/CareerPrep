<h2>Formatting &amp; Markdown</h2>
<h3>Formatted Text</h3>
<img src="assets/images/word.jpg" alt="word document"/>
<p>Text is cool, but you know what's <strong>really cool?</strong> <em><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="tooltip" data-tip="Formatted text, styled text, or rich text- as opposed to plain text- has encoded styling information: colors, styles (boldface, italic), sizes, and special features (such as hyperlinks).">formatted text</a></em>. Let's translate our <code>.txt</code> text document introducing our partner into a <code>.rtf</code> Rich Text Format one.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Search <code>[CMD + SPACE]</code> for the <em>textEdit</em> application and create a formatted document.</li>
  <li>Copy in the notes from your interview.</li>
  <li>Use the GUI-style toolbar to create bold, italic, and underlined text.</li>
  <li>Set the color of certain text and background sections.</li>
  <li>Change the font face, font size, and font style.</li>
  <li>Change the justification (left, center, right).</li>
  <li>Create bulleted and numbered lists.</li>
  <li>Get help<code>[CMD + SHIFT + ?]</code> to find the "attach file" option to add a picture</li>
  <li>Get help<code>[CMD + SHIFT + ?]</code> to find the "add link" option to link selected text to a <a href="students/reference/file_path.html" class='popup'>file path</a> or <a href="//simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator" class='popup'>url</a>.</li>
  <li>Save the document<code>[CMD + S]</code> with a <code>.rtf</code> file extension</li>
  <li>Try opening your <code>.rtf</code> document using Atom. What's up with that?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Markdown</h3>
<p>Formatted text is nice, but clicking buttons will never scale. We need to be able to <a href="javascript:void(0)" class='tooltip' data-tip="Done with code, rather than via direct user interaction. For example, consider resizing columns in Excel. You could manually click and drag every column, or you could write a script to cycle through each and set its width property.">programmatically</a> describe how we want our text processed.</p>
<p>Markdown is a markup language. Markup languages mix-in special sequences of coded characters to specify the intended layout and style of their text.</p>
<p>Copy this Markdown code into your Atom code editor and search for 'markdown preview' in the command palette <code>[CMD + SHIFT + P]</code> to have it parsed and rendered.</p>
<pre><code class='markdown'># This is a header
## This is an even smaller header
### Even smaller...
###### Quite small

Here is some normal text. A paragraph, even!

*This text is in italics.*

**This text is in bold.**

***This text is in both.***

~~This text is rendered with strikethrough.~~

Sometimes you want to embed some \*stylized text\*
right into **your paragraph.** Pretty cool, right!

* Item
* Item
* Another item

or

+ Item
+ Item
+ One more item

or

- Item

1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three

w/ sub-lists

<h2>Markdown Exercises</h2>

<p>The <code>local photo</code> showed up fine for me... How come it's broken for you?</p>
<p>Copy the interview with your partner into Atom and mark it up in the Markdown format. Use <code>[CTRL + SHIFT + L]</code> to set the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class='tooltip' data-tip="A system of rules by which to interpret text characters in a file in order to a meaningful set of instructions which can be acted upon. ">encoding language</a> for the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting" class='popup'>syntax highlighter</a>. At a minimum, use the following formatting:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Headers of several different sizes</li>
  <li>italic text</li>
  <li>bold text</li>
  <li>an unordered list</li>
  <li>an ordered list</li>
  <li>a "horizontal rule" delimiter</li>
  <li>a link to a web page</li>
  <li>a link to an image on the web</li>
  <li>a link to an image on your computer</li>
  <li>Link to a few of their favorite web sites</li>
  <li>Be creative! <a href="//learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/" class='popup'>Explore...</a></li>
</ol>

<p>When you are done, save your work as a <a href="https://gist.github.com/">public gist</a> and share it in slack chat. Copy a few other people's markdown files into your Atom code editor and practice using "markdown preview" to show them in their rendered form.</p>

<p>Use the command palette to copy the markdown as HTML. Paste it into a new document and puzzle over it.</p>

<h3>Challenge:</h3>
<p>Over the course of this class, you are going to build the Internet's premier watering hole for a very specific community. Examples include: Foodies in Topeka, Russian-speaking fantasy football enthusiasts, and alpaca-fur-loving fashionitas.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take a moment to think of a couple of ideas. They can be funny or serious or anything else. No rules.</li>
  <li>Close your eyes and envision your ideal community members in as much detail as possible. How will they want to interact with your site? Are you excited to invest time in helping these people?</li>
  <li>Collect feedback about your ideas from some of your classmates. Also take some time to get to know them a little.</li>
  <li>Give them your feedback on their ideas.</li>
  <li>Decide on your final idea and prepare a 30-second elevator pitch to present it to the class.</li>
  <li>Create a one page "pitch sheet" using Markdown to hand out to investors. Include some charts and graphs as well as inspirational stock photography.</li>
</ol>
