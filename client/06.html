<h1>Intro to JavaScript</h1>
<section>
  <h3>JavaScript!</h3>
    <p>We've learned how the browser retrieves an HTML document, either from the hard drive or over a network connection, loads it into memory as a <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip" data-tip="Document Object Model, the browser's tree-like, in-memory representation of the page state (pictured below)">DOM</a>, and renders it to the page with CSS styling applied.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/dom2.png" alt="DOM">
    <p>We can view the page, scroll around, click on a link to change pages, or submit a form. But other than that, once the page is rendered to the screen, it is functionally inert.</p>

    <p>If we want more complex interactive behavior we need to use a <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip" data-tip="Scripts are files comprised of lines of code that can be read one at a time and interpreted as a series instructions to the computer. Scripts can automate the execution of tasks that would otherwise have to be typed in command-by-command by a human operator">scripting language</a> like JavaScript to describe what should happen when and how.</p>

    <p>Before we start throwing down &lt;script&gt; tags or creating our own <code>.js</code> files, let's write a few lines by hand in the console.</p>

  <h3>The JavaScript Console</h3>
    <p>So far, we have used Chrome's developer tools to check out the DOM and see a webpage's CSS. Now, we'll learn how to use Chrome's JavaScript console to write JavaScript.
    <p>Go ahead and open up your Chrome Developer Tools (<code>[CMD + SHIFT + ?]</code> if you forget how) and switch to the <strong>JavaScript Console.</strong> The Console is a <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip" data-tip="A Read Evaluate Print Loop waits for the user to input an instruction and press ENTER to signal they're done. The interpreter then READs the command, EVALUATEs (runs/ executes/ resolves) it, PRINTs the result, and LOOPs back to wait for another command.">REPL</a>. We can use the JavaScript console to write some JavaScript without creating a file. Let's play around in the JavaScript console!</p>

  <warn><p>The internet, quite simply put, serves to transfer data from one place to another. Data types form the basic building blocks of understanding JavaScript. Today we'll learn about basic data types: Numbers, Strings and Booleans. We'll pick up some nifty math operators along the way.</p></warn>

  <h3>The Number Data Type & Math Operators</h3>
    <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Type each of the following lines of code (<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip" data-tip="An expression is a series of values, variables and operators that, when interpreted, return a value. For example: 2+3 is an expression which evaluates to 5.">expressions</a>) into the console one at a time and consider the result.</p>
    <ul class='code'>
      <li><code>&gt; 2 + 3</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; 3 * 5 + 4</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; 3 * (5 + 4)</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; -300 * 2.57</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip" data-tip="the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another">25 % 6</a></code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; 1e4 * 2</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What have we learned?</strong> We can use the console as a simple caluculator by employing values with the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip" data-tip="All data are series of binary digits (1001001110), but we can encode them to mean different things. A data type refers to meta-data which determines if this value is a number, a string of letters, a boolean value (true/false), or something more complex like an object (collection of related information) or function (set of instructions).">data type</a> of number and mathematical <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip" data-tip="constructs which behave generally like subroutines (a sequence of instructions that perform a specific task), but often look like punctuation rather than names">operators</a> such as +, -, *, /, %.</p>
    <p><b>Exercise:</b> From the console, calculate how many seconds old you are.</p>
    <p><b>Exercise:</b> How can you tell whether a number is even or odd using the console?</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>The String Data Type</h3>
    <ul class="code">
      <li><code>&gt; "Hello, how are you?"</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The string data type denotes a sequence of alphanumeric characters which are often useful for communicating information to weak-minded humans who aren't able to interact using pure logic.</p>

    <p>What happens if we try to type the following into the console without the quotes?</p>
    <ul class="code">
      <li><code>&gt; Hello, how are you?</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>We can evaluate non-numerical expressions as well. <b>To what value does the following expression resolve when evaluted?</b></p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li><code>&gt; 'Just fine,' + ' ' + 'thank you'</code></li>
      </ul>
    <p>String concatenation is the operation of joining character strings end-to-end.</p>

    <p><b>Exercise:</b> Is the following a string or a number?</p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li><code>&gt; '5'</code></li>
      </ul>
    <p><b>Exercise:</b> What do you get for the following? Why do you think?</p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li><code>&gt; 5 + 'hello world'</code></li>
        <li><code>&gt; 'hello world' + 5</code></li>
      </ul>
  <hr>

  <h3><code>typeof</code></h3>
    <p><code>typeof</code> is also an operator and similar to the math operators we learned above. Instead of telling you what it does, let's have you figure it out!</p>
    <p><b>Exercise:</b> Try the following. What do we get?</p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li><code>&gt; typeof '5'</code></li>
        <li><code>&gt; TYPEOF '5'</code> <small>why does this not work?</small></li>
        <li><code>&gt; typeof 5</code></li>
        <li><code>&gt; typeof 'hello world'</code></li>
        <li><code>&gt; typeof 'hello world' + 1</code></li>
      </ul>
  <hr>

  <h3>Alerting and Prompting Using <code>window</code></h3>
    <p>The <code>window</code> keyword is a special thingy (it's actually an object, which we'll learn about later on) that holds information about the currently open browser tab. It contains many <b>properties</b> (simply put: associated pieces of data), of which, the DOM (document) is one. Here are a few more, <b>check 'em out</b></p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li><code>&gt; window.document</code></li>
        <li><code>&gt; window.location</code></li>
        <li><code>&gt; window.history</code></li>
      </ul>
    <p>What do these get you? What do you think they are?</p>

    <p>You can also look at the <code>window</code> object directly, but be warned, <b>it's intense!</b></p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li><code>&gt; window</code></li>
      </ul>
    <p>Not only does the <code>window</code> object give us access to the current browser tab's state, we can also use it to issue commands to the browser. <b>What does this command do?</b></p>
      <ul class=code>
        <li><code>&gt; window.alert("Jello, whirled")</code></li>
      </ul>

    <p>Similar to the Terminal, the first part of the command references what <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip" data-tip="AKA subroutine: A sequence of program instructions that perform a specific task."><i>function</i></a> we're looking to run. Next comes the invokation operator <code class=hl >()</code> - similar to a mathematical operator ( +, -, * ) - which causes the JavaScript interpreter to actually run the function. Inside the parentheses we place the arguments we wish to pass as input. <small>(In this case the string to be displayed)</small></p>

    <p>The <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip" data-tip="A series of values, variables and operators that, when interpreted, return a value.">expression</a> <code>2 + 3</code> resolves to the <b>value</b> 5. What value does the following expression resolve to? What is its <b>data type</b>?</p>
    <ul class="code">
      <li><code>&gt; window.prompt("How are you feeling today?")</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <code>window</code> context is implied.</p>

    <ul class="code">
      <li><code>&gt; alert("Jello, whirled")</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; prompt("How are you feeling today?")</code></li>
    </ul>
  <hr>

  <h3>Where Does Your JavaScript Go?</h3>
    <p>Let's move away from Chrome's console and towards something a bit more permanent. Let's stick some JavaScript into some HTML!</p>
    <p>In the same way that a &lt;style&gt; tag tells the browser to switch from the HTML interpreter to the CSS interpreter to read code inside it, the &lt;script&gt; tag tells the browser to interpret its contents according to the rules of JavaScript. </p>
      <pre><code class="html">&lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
          &lt;h1&gt;mah payge&lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;yup, yup&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;script&gt;
            // the interpreter will skip any line that starts with a double slash
            // these lines are explanatory comments to help squishy-brained humans

            alert("Welcome to mah deng website, brah!")
            prompt("How's it going?")
          &lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
      </code></pre>

    <alert>Always, always, always, always, always, always, always place your script tags <b>directly before the closing body tag &lt;/body&gt;</b> in your HTML document. Always. Always. If you follow this simple rule, you will save yourself several dozen frustrating hours of debugging over the course of your career. You're welcome. <small><i>(p.s. yes, always)</i></small></alert>
  <hr>

  <h3>Exercise: Your First JavaScript Enabled Web Page</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a new HTML document, correctly set up with html, head, and body tags</li>
      <li>Add a script tag <b>directly before the closing body tag</b>.</li>
      <li>Inside of a script tag, alert visitors that your site is extremely awesome and should thus be enjoyed with caution.</li>
      <li>Prompt the user for their name</li>
      <li>Greet them by name using another alert</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you're using Sublime, you can right-click and pick "Show in Browser" to see and test it in a browser.</p>
    <p>This one's tough, but do give a good go at it before raising your hand for help. Hint for steps 4 and 5: Think of your prompt as an expression. What value does it resolve to? And what value do you need inside of your second alert?</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>Logging</h3>
    <p>Ok, though illustrative, alerts are annoying. That's why they're not often used. It is more usual to use the console to output information. <b>Try this:</b></p>
      <pre><code class="html">&lt;script&gt;
      window.console.log("Where is this message displayed?")
      &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>Or, more succinctly:</p>
      <pre><code class="html">&lt;script&gt;
        console.log("This is mostly used for debugging.", "We'll learn how to write directly into the HTML document a little later.")
        &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

    <p><b>Exercise:</b> Ask the user what their favorite sports team is. Secretly log a message trash-talking their team in the console.</p>
    <p><b>Exercise:</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go back through your past projects and add a &lt;script&gt; tag at the bottom of each page, right before the &lt;/body&gt;.</li>
        <li>Add some secret console.log goodness to each.</li>
        <li>Add more JavaScript as you see fit.</li>
      </ol>
  <hr>


  <h3>Variables</h3>
    <p id=welcome_message>In programming, it can be extremely useful to store values for later use. Variables are identifiers (labels, nametags) used to set and retrieve stored values. They are called variables because you can change what value they hold based on user input, the current program state, etc.</p>

    <p>We use the <code>var</code> keyword to declare a variable. When first declared, variables have a value of <code>undefined</code>. The assignment <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip" data-tip="constructs which behave generally like subroutines (a sequence of instructions that perform a specific task), but often look like punctuation rather than names">operator</a> stores a value. <b>Type along in your console:</b></p>

    <ul class="code">
      <li><code>&gt; var x</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; x</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; x = 1</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; x + 4</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; x </code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; x = 5</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; var y = 2</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; x + y + 7</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; y = x + 7</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>So when we write <code class=hl>var rate = 100</code> your JavaScript Runtime Environment jots down the variable "rate" in its ledger and gives it a pointer to a memory location:</p>
    <img src=assets/images/var.png alt=variable class=full>

    <p>Type the following in your console one line at a time <small>(don't type the comments)</small>:</p>
      <ul class="code">
        <li><code>&gt; my_variable</code> // what does this error mean?</li>
        <li><code>&gt; var my_variable</code></li>
        <li><code>&gt; my_variable</code> // what has changed from the first line?</li>
        <li><code>&gt; my_variable = "I'm a string value!"</code></li>
        <li><code>&gt; typeof my_variable</code></li>
      </ul>

  <h3>Pass By Value</h3>
    <p>What is the value of <code>first</code> at the end of this sequence?</p>

    <ul class="code">
      <li><code>&gt; var first, second</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; first = "hello"</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; second = "goodbye"</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; first = second</code></li>
      <li><code>&gt; second = "wait, you've forgotten your hat!"</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In JavaScript, primitives (numbers, strings, booleans) are <i>pass by value</i>. This means that when you set one variable equal to another, the value stored there is copied over, and the two variables retain no lasting connection to each other. <small>(objects are <i>pass by reference</i>, we'll learn how that's different later)</small></p>
  <hr>

  <h3>Review</h3>

    <h4>Exercise 1:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Declare variables a, b and c. Assign a number to each.</li>
      <li>Declare variable d and assign it the value of a, b, and c added together.</li>
      <li>Re-assign the value of b to a. Then change the value of b. What is the value of a?</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Exercise 2:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Create variables "hour" and "minute" to reflect the current time.</li>
      <li>Write an expression to calculate how many seconds until midnight.</li>
      <li>Change "minute" to be accurate again as time has probably passed.</li>
      <li>Run the same calculation again (press the up key in the console to scroll back to it).</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Exercise 3:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Declare at least 10 variables such as 'name', 'age', 'birthday', 'hometown', 'occupation', 'favoriteFood', 'bestFriend', etc, and set their values equal to strings containing the appropriate information about yourself.</li>
      <li>console.log a paragraph about yourself using the appropriate variables to insert the relevant information in the appropriate places.</li>
      <li>Create a new HTML document and re-write the variables and the console.log in a &lt;script&gt; tag so that you'll have it for later.</li>
    </ol>

  <h3>Manipulating the DOM</h3>
  <p><code>console.log</code> is great for debugging, but more frequently, we'll want our JavaScript to change the visible page. First, let's ask the document to return us the first element that it finds that matches a valid CSS selector.</p>

  <p>Open <a href=students/examples/selecting.html target=_blank>this page</a> and try the following in the JavaScript console:</p>
  <ul class=code>
    <li><code>&gt; document.body</code></li>
    <li><code>&gt; document.querySelector('p')</code></li>
    <li><code>&gt; document.querySelector('#primary')</code></li>
    <li><code>&gt; document.querySelector('.important')</code></li>
    <li><code>&gt; document.querySelector('p.important').textContent</code></li>
    <li><code>&gt; document.querySelector('#nav ol li').textContent</code></li>
    <li><code>&gt; document.querySelector('h1, p').textContent = "I'm on the page!"</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Exercise:</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open up one of your previous HTML projects</li>
    <li>Use the console to retrieve the first element that matches a particular CSS selector.</li>
    <li>View that element's current textContent from the console.</li>
    <li>Set that element's textContent to a new string.</li>
    <li>Do this exercise once for each selector type shown above.</li>
  </ol>
  <hr>
  <ul class="code">
    <li><code>&gt; document.querySelector('h1').textContent = "Behold! For I am a mighty web document!"</code></li>
    <li><code>&gt; var big_shot = document.querySelector('#primary')</code></li>
    <li><code>&gt; big_shot.textContent = "Flippin' heck, I'm by far the most important element around!"</code></li>
    <li><code>&gt; document.querySelector('.important').textContent = "Do all .important elements change or only one?"</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Exercise:</b> Design an HTML page with HTML elements to match the selectors used above. With that page loaded into the browser, type the above expressions into the console. <b>Do your changes persist if you reload the page? Why is this?</b> </p>

  <p>Now move the JavaScript code into a script tag just before the &lt;/body&gt;. <b>What's changed?</b></p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Greeter!</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a fresh HTML document with correctly set up html, head, and body tags</li>
    <li>Create a &lt;div&gt; with an id of <code>greeting</code> on your web page.</li>
    <li>Prompt the user to enter their name. Set their response equal to a variable <code>visitor_name</code>.</li>
    <li>Create a variable <code>welcome_message</code> and construct a welcoming message using their name.</li>
    <li>Make your welcome message visible on the page using querySelector and textContent.</li>
    <li>Prompt the user for their hometown and save their answer as a variable <code>town</code></li>
    <li>Put an empty &lt;span&gt; with the id of <code>hometown</code> on the page in the middle of an existing sentence already on the page letting them know how nice it is to have a visitor from <i>blank</i>.</li>
    <li>Use the <code>town</code> variable and the <code>#hometown</code> span to make the compliment complete! </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Shuffle!</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a &lt;div&gt; with an id of <code>source</code>, and one with the id of <code>destination</code>, each with some text inside.</li>
    <li>Fetch the textContent of <code>source</code> and save it as a variable.</li>
    <li>Use the variable to place that text in the <code>destination</code> div</li>
    <li>Create &lt;div&gt;s with a ids of <code>swap_1</code> and <code>swap_2</code>.</li>
    <li>How can we swap the textContent of the two divs?</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Mad Libs!</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a "Mad Libs" web page. It should tell a story, leaving empty &lt;spans&gt;'s with id attributes of 'noun1', 'adjective2', 'verb3', etc. Practice using the console along with `querySelector` and `textContent` to fill in the missing information one at a time.</li>
    <li>After doing this manually, put these operations into a script tag, and use variables to store each word to be filled in before placing it into the web page, so that the template will be filled out automatically each time the page loads, but the information will be easy to change later.</li>
    <li>Finally, prompt the visitor repeatedly to provide their own mad libs words. Save their responses as variables and then place those variables into the page to make a crazy story for them.</li>
  </ol>
  <hr>
  <h3>[Optional Content]</h3>
  <h4>Advanced Mathematical Operators</h4>
  <p>Play with the following in your console until you understand how they work:</p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">num = 1
  num = num + 5

  // assignment
  num += 5
  num -= 1
  num *= 3
  num /= 0.5

  // increment and decrement
  num++
  num--

  // operators before the variable
  // what's the difference?
  ++num
  --num</code></pre>
  <hr>

  <h4>Escaping Strings</h4>
  <p><code>&gt; "Well now...\nThis is " + "rather clever, \n\tdon't you think?"</code></p>

  <p>An escape character indicates an alternative interpretation of the subsequent character in a character sequence. In JavaScript the slash character denotes that the character after it might be a tab (\t) or new line (\n).</p>

  <p><code>&gt; '"Single quotes work too" ,she said.' + " " + 'Though I\'d not thought it possible'</code></p>
  <p>Escape characters may be needed to indicate that we're looking to print a literal single (\') or double quote (\") and not signal the end of a string of text.</p>
  <p><b>Fix the following so it will run successfully in your console:</b></p>
  <p><code>'"What's wrong with the pudding?", she'd say with a smile.'</code></p>
  <p><b>Now this one:</b></p>
  <p><code>'I'd often think' * "to myself, "Well, what's the worst wrong that could go wrong?". I guess" * "now we know..."</code></p>
